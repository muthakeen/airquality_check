**Register Number:** 41062324360 

## Dataset  
**Source:** [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
**File Used:** `telco.csv`

## Project Overview  
This project uses data preprocessing, feature encoding, and three different models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Requirements  
To run this notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run  
1. Open the notebook using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload both the notebook and dataset file.
3. Run each cell sequentially.

## Output  
- Classification reports and accuracy for each model
- Confusion matrix plots
- Sample prediction using the trained Random Forest model

## Future Improvements  
- Use deep learning techniques like neural networks  
- Add model performance visualizations  
- Build a Flask web app for user input and prediction
